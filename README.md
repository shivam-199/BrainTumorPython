# BrainTumorPython
The repository contains the python notebook and the final working CNN model used in Kaggle's [Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/jakeshbohaju/brain-tumor) challenge

**Summary of the Model**

Keras Tensorflow framework used for classification. Train accuracy: 99.77% Test accuracy: 91.77%

Image dimensions: 224 * 224 * 3

Further playing with the hyper parameters may help in reducing the gap between train and test accuracy.
